# Video Generation Pipeline Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive video generation pipeline system with human checkpoints, approvals, and tracking as requested in Issue #7.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Type Definitions (`lib/types.ts`)
- **PipelineStage**: Enum defining all pipeline stages (idea, idea_review, script, script_approval, storyboard, storyboard_approval, video, video_qa, published)
- **WorkflowPipeline**: Complete pipeline state management
- **PipelineCheckpoint**: Human approval checkpoints
- **PipelineRule**: Automation rules for stage processing

#### 2. Pipeline Orchestrator (`lib/services/workflow-pipeline.ts`)
- **WorkflowPipelineService**: Main pipeline orchestration
- Creates and manages pipeline lifecycle
- Handles stage advancement with automatic and manual transitions
- Manages checkpoints and approvals
- Implements rollback functionality
- Integrates with job queue for automated processing

#### 3. Pipeline Database Layer (`lib/db/pipeline.ts`)
- **PipelineDB**: Database operations for pipelines, checkpoints, and rules
- Firestore integration with proper data formatting
- CRUD operations for all pipeline entities

#### 4. Pipeline Manager (`lib/services/pipeline-manager.ts`)
- **PipelineManager**: High-level pipeline management
- Project initialization with custom configuration
- Progress tracking and metrics calculation
- Bulk operations for approvals
- Analytics and reporting
- Automation rule management

#### 5. Real-time Tracker (`lib/services/pipeline-tracker.ts`)
- **PipelineTracker**: Real-time pipeline monitoring
- Live progress updates via Firestore listeners
- Dashboard aggregation for multiple projects
- Performance metrics and bottleneck detection
- Historical analysis and reporting

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Pipeline Orchestration
- End-to-end workflow: Idea → Review → Script → Approve → Video → QA → Publish
- Stage-by-stage progression with validation
- Integration with existing queue system for automated processing

### ✅ Human Checkpoints
- Configurable approval points at key stages
- Multi-reviewer support with required approval counts
- Feedback collection and revision requests
- Escalation workflows for blocked items

### ✅ Approval System
- Stage-specific approval requirements
- Bulk approval operations
- Approval history and audit trails
- Automatic advancement on approval

### ✅ Real-time Notifications
- Email, push, and in-app notification channels
- Stage completion and approval request alerts
- Escalation notifications
- Progress milestone updates

### ✅ Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress percentages
- Stage completion timestamps and durations
- Bottleneck identification
- Estimated completion times

### ✅ Rollback Functionality
- Rollback to previous stages with reason tracking
- Artifact preservation during rollbacks
- State reset with notification of affected parties

### ✅ Analytics and Metrics
- Stage performance analytics (duration, success rate, revision rate)
- Pipeline bottleneck identification
- Completion time predictions
- Improvement recommendations

### ✅ Artifact Management
- Stage-specific artifact storage (scripts, storyboards, videos, feedback)
- Version tracking and history
- Artifact linking to pipeline stages

## Stage Flow

```
1. IDEA → 2. IDEA_REVIEW → 3. SCRIPT → 4. SCRIPT_APPROVAL → 
5. STORYBOARD → 6. STORYBOARD_APPROVAL → 7. VIDEO → 8. VIDEO_QA → 9. PUBLISHED
```

### Checkpoint Stages (Human Review Required)
- **Idea Review**: Initial concept approval
- **Script Approval**: Content and structure review
- **Storyboard Approval**: Visual sequence approval
- **Video QA**: Final quality assurance

### Automated Stages
- **Idea**: Initial creation
- **Script**: AI-generated script creation
- **Storyboard**: AI-generated storyboard creation
- **Video**: AI video generation
- **Published**: Final publication

## Database Schema

### Collections
- `workflowPipelines`: Main pipeline documents
- `pipelineCheckpoints`: Approval checkpoint documents
- `pipelineRules`: Automation rule configurations
- `notifications`: Real-time notification events

## API Usage Examples

```typescript
// Initialize pipeline for project
const pipelineId = await PipelineManager.initializeProjectPipeline(
  'project-123', 
  'user-456',
  {
    skipStages: ['storyboard'], // Optional stage skipping
    customReviewers: { 
      script_approval: ['reviewer1', 'reviewer2'] 
    }
  }
);

// Check project progress
const progress = await PipelineManager.getProjectProgress('project-123');
console.log(`Progress: ${progress.progressPercentage}% - ${progress.currentStage}`);

// Approve checkpoint
await WorkflowPipelineService.approveCheckpoint('checkpoint-789', 'reviewer-123', 'Looks great!');

// Subscribe to real-time updates
const unsubscribe = pipelineTracker.subscribeToProjectPipeline('project-123', (progress) => {
  console.log('Pipeline updated:', progress);
});

// Get performance analytics
const metrics = await tracker.getStagePerformanceMetrics('script_approval', {
  start: new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  end: new Date()
});
```

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Queue System**: Integrates with existing job queue for automated processing
- **Project Management**: Extends existing project status tracking
- **Notification System**: Uses existing notification infrastructure
- **User Management**: Leverages existing user and permission system

### Firebase Services
- **Firestore**: Primary data storage
- **Cloud Functions**: Server-side processing (job queue integration)
- **Authentication**: User-based permissions and assignments

## Performance Considerations

- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Efficient Firestore listeners with automatic cleanup
- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized batch processing for multiple approvals
- **Caching**: Stage metrics caching for improved dashboard performance
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed queries for fast pipeline and checkpoint retrieval

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Checkpoint assignments based on user roles
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of all pipeline actions
- **Permission Validation**: Verification of user permissions before actions
- **Data Isolation**: User-scoped data access patterns

## Future Enhancements

- **Custom Stage Configuration**: Allow projects to define custom pipeline stages
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-based bottleneck prediction
- **Integration APIs**: External system integration hooks
- **Mobile App Support**: Native mobile app integration for approvals
- **Slack/Teams Integration**: Notification integration with team chat platforms

## Dependencies

- Firebase SDK v10+
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Node.js 18+
- Jest for testing
- ESLint for code quality
